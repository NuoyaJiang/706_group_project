    Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterial pathogen _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, which mainly affects the lungs of the patients. Annually, more than 1 million patients die of TB worldwide, making TB the second leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, following COVID-19 [[1](https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2023)].
    More distressingly, recent years have witnessed a rapid rise in _Mtb_'s ability to resist antibiotics, such as Rifampicin. This severely increased the difficulty to treat TB, posing a serious threat to human health [[2](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/resp.13304)].
