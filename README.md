Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which mainly affects the lungs of the patients. Annually, more than 1 million patients die of TB worldwide, making TB the second leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, following COVID-19. More distressingly, recent years have witnessed a rapid rise in Mtb's ability to resist antibiotics, such as Rifampicin. This severely increased the difficulty to treat TB, posing a serious threat to human health.

In this project, we visualize its rising trend in drug resistance, the burden caused by drug resistance, and socioeconomic factors that may help us hamper the trend with data from WHO Global Tuberculosis Programme. We hope our efforts could raise more awareness of the issue.
